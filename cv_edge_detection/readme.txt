Our Presentation has 3 parts:

1,Basic idea of edge detection
2,Second order & Laplacian
3,LoG operator(Marr-Hildreth operator)

compare_with_first_order.py is for 1,2

main.py is for 3
main_without_opencv.py is the version without opencv. (We just used opencv as performance comparison, so it does not matter if your python environment do not has opencv or matched version of opencv3)

timer.py is just for estimate performance
